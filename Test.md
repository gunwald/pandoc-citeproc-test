Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, [This is a simple footnote, with a preffix @aristoteles1983, pp 213-214; @aristoteles1984, pp 11, and a suffix.] sed diam.^[Here we have a complex footnote, as often used in humanities, here we can't use semicolons to seperate the references to the sources. But pandoc-citeproc is able to parse them anyway, as long as we use \^[ â€¦ ], only the colon after the contributer is wrong: See @aristoteles1991, pp 213-214. Duis autem vel eum iriure dolor in hendrerit in vulputate velit esse molestie consequat, vel illum dolore eu feugiat nulla facilisis. @aristoteles1984]
